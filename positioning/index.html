    <main>
        <!-- 1. Relative Positioning -->
        <section class="demo-section">
            <h2>1. Relative Positioning</h2>
            <p>The element is positioned relative to its normal document flow. It keeps its original space.</p>
            <div class="box-container">
                <div class="box static">Static</div>
                <div class="box relative">Relative (Moved!)</div>
                <div class="box static">Static</div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- 2. Absolute Positioning -->
        <section class="demo-section">
            <h2>2. Absolute Positioning</h2>
            <p>The element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to its nearest <strong>positioned</strong> ancestor.</p>
            <div class="box-container absolute-parent">
                <div class="box static">Static</div>
                <div class="box absolute">Absolute</div>
                <div class="box static">Static</div>
                <p class="note">Notice how the static boxes jumped to fill the gap.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- 3. Fixed Positioning -->
        <section class="demo-section">
            <h2>3. Fixed Positioning</h2>
            <p>The element is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport). It stays in the same place even when you scroll.</p>
            <div class="box fixed">Fixed Box</div>
            <div class="scroll-filler">
                <p>Scroll down to see the fixed box stay in place...</p>
                <div class="filler-line"></div>
                <div class="filler-line"></div>
                <div class="filler-line"></div>
                <div class="filler-line"></div>
                <div class="filler-line"></div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- 4. Sticky Positioning -->
        <section class="demo-section">
            <h2>4. Sticky Positioning</h2>
            <p>The element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It sticks to a specific offset within its container.</p>
            <div class="sticky-container">
                <div class="box sticky">Sticky Box</div>
                <div class="scroll-content">
                    <p>Scroll inside this box to see the sticky behavior in action...</p>
                    <p>Cats are fascinating creatures that have been companions to humans for thousands of years. Domesticated cats,
                        scientifically known as Felis catus, are small carnivorous mammals that belong to the family Felidae. These
                        remarkable animals have captured the hearts of millions of people around the world with their independent yet
                        affectionate nature.</p>
                    <p>The history of cats and their relationship with humans dates back approximately 9,000 years to ancient civilizations
                        in the Near East. Archaeological evidence suggests that cats were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, where
                        they helped protect grain stores from rodents. Ancient Egyptians particularly revered cats, considering them sacred
                        animals and even mummifying them alongside their owners.</p>
                    <p>Cats possess incredible physical abilities that make them exceptional hunters. Their flexible bodies contain 230
                        bones, which is about 24 more than humans have. This skeletal structure, combined with powerful muscles, allows cats
                        to twist and turn with remarkable agility. They can rotate their ears 180 degrees to pinpoint the source of sounds,
                        and their eyes contain a special reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum that enhances their night vision,
                        making them excellent nocturnal predators.</p>
                    <p>One of the most distinctive features of cats is their retractable claws. Unlike dogs, cats can extend and retract
                        their claws at will, keeping them sharp for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. This unique adaptation also allows
                        them to move silently when stalking prey. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies are designed to derive
                        nutrients primarily from animal tissue rather than plant material.</p>
                    <p>Communication in cats is a complex system involving vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. While cats can
                        produce over 100 different vocal sounds compared to dogs' mere 10, they primarily communicate through body language.
                        A cat's tail position, ear orientation, and pupil dilation can convey a wide range of emotions from contentment to
                        fear or aggression. Purring, perhaps the most recognizable cat sound, typically indicates contentment but can also
                        occur when cats are stressed or in pain.</p>
                    <p>Domestic cats come in an astounding variety of breeds, colors, and patterns. From the hairless Sphynx to the
                        luxuriously fluffy Persian, from the spotted Bengal to the color-pointed Siamese, there's a cat breed to suit almost
                        every preference. Each breed has its own unique characteristics, temperament, and care requirements. Some breeds are
                        known for being particularly vocal, like the Siamese, while others like the Russian Blue tend to be quieter and more
                        reserved.</p>
                    <p>Cats spend a significant portion of their lives sleeping, averaging 12 to 16 hours per day, with some cats sleeping
                        up to 20 hours. This extensive sleep pattern is an evolutionary adaptation from their wild ancestors, who needed to
                        conserve energy between hunts. Cats experience both REM and non-REM sleep cycles, and they do dream, often twitching
                        their whiskers, paws, and tails during deep sleep phases.</p>
                    <p>The grooming behavior of cats is not just about cleanliness; it serves multiple purposes including temperature
                        regulation, stress relief, and social bonding. Cats have barbed tongues covered in tiny hook-like structures called
                        papillae that act like a comb, removing loose fur and debris. When cats groom each other, a behavior called
                        allogrooming, it strengthens social bonds and helps them establish group scent.</p>
                    <p>Understanding cat behavior and body language is essential for building a strong relationship with these independent
                        animals. A slow blink from a cat is often called a "cat kiss" and indicates trust and affection. When a cat kneads
                        with their paws, alternating between left and right, they're displaying a behavior from kittenhood when they would
                        knead their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow. This behavior in adult cats typically indicates contentment and
                        comfort.</p>
                    <p>Modern cat care has evolved significantly, with advances in veterinary medicine, nutrition, and our understanding of
                        feline behavior. Regular veterinary check-ups, proper nutrition, environmental enrichment, and mental stimulation
                        are all crucial for maintaining a healthy and happy cat. Indoor cats typically live longer than outdoor cats, with
                        lifespans ranging from 12 to 18 years or even longer with proper care.</p>
